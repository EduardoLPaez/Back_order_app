Hello. this application is intended as a sort of extension for a store using the Square application for inventory management and sales. The purpose of this application is to create a catalog of back-order goods, in this case meaning goods that are not currently in stock and are to be purchased and distributed to those whom placed the order for said goods. 
    this application will be using the Square API, Kivy framework to facilitate the interface with IOS devices as these are the ones most used by the target company, as well as SQLite for a simple database to store simplified customer and goods information.
